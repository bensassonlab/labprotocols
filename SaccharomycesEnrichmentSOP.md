# Enrichment of _Saccharomyces_ yeast

Future improvements: 

## Introduction

We adapted the enrichment medium in Sniegowski et al 2002, by increasing the chloramphenicol to 10 mg/ml. Many yeast species were successfully isolated with Sniegowski enrichment media and selection plates in Robinson et al 2016, including S. paradoxus, S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, K. lactis (Robinson et al 2016).  


### Sniegowski’s enrichment medium.
This medium includes 7.6% EtOH, so there is selection against microbes with low tolerance to EtOH (_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ has high tolerance to EtOH). Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic, which at low concentrations like this inhibits DNA replication of prokaryotic DNA (and only inhibits eukaryotic growth at higher concentrations). As for wine fermentation, the main carbon source is sucrose, and the medium has been made acidic with HCl (lemon or vinegar are often added for home-made wine) because yeast like acidic media. 

**Sniegowski’s enrichment medium** (1 litre)\
3g Yeast Extract\
3g Malt Extract\
5g Bacto peptone\
10g Sucrose\
76mls Ethanol (95%)\
10mg Chloramphenicol (or 400ul from a 25mg/ml stock solution dissolved in EtOH)\
1ml 1M Hydrochloric acid

Filter sterilise. Do not autoclave.

### Sniegowski’s selection plates
All nitrogen sources and amino acids are provided, but the sole carbon source here is methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. _Saccharomyces_ yeasts can usually metabolise methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, so are usually able to grow slowly on these plates, whereas many other microbes cannot. Note however that not all _S. cerevisiae_ yeasts can grow on these plates and in fact the laboratory yeast strain we usually use, an S288C derived strain (BY4743), actually does not grow on these plates.

**10x Sniegowski’s selection plate medium stock** (500ml)\
100g Methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside\
33.5g Yeast Nitrogen Base with amino acids and ammonium sulphate\
20ml 1M Hydrochloric acid

Filter sterlise. Do not autoclave. Store the stock in the fridge, until ready mix with 2% agar for pouring plates.

To pour Sniegowski’s selection plates: microwave 400ml 2% agar (autoclaved), add 44ml 10x Sniegowski selection plate medium, mix well and pour.

## Health and safety and other precautions - Important Please Read!
Gloves should be worn at all times. All field **negative controls** should be processed the same way as the field samples (even though we expect to see no yeast growing in these). Include **positive controls** in the lab by inoculating media with the target species to ensure that it can grow in these media. If you are reading this and you are in the Bensasson lab then please talk to me about what strains you should be using for your positive controls!

## Procedure
Procedure should be followed working under sterile conditions: under a lit flame or in a biosafety cabinet. 

Before and after collecting samples, each tube should be weighted to determine the sample's weight. 

Tube containing sample (7ml, 15ml, 30ml or 50ml) is filled with Sniegowski’s enrichment medium and the cap is tightened. The tubes are placed in a rack in a heat tolerant plastic box with the lid on, and left standing in a 30C incubator for 10 days to 3 months.  

The sample cap should be untightened carefully with the cap wrapped in tissue (the sample could be fizzy, which could cause it to spray). Occasionally, 5ul of the enrichment medium is transferred to a microscope slide, covered and viewed under the microscope. Slides are disposed of in a biohazard sharps bin.

50ul of the enrichment medium is streaked onto Sniegowski’s selection plates at 30C for several days. If growth on Sniegowski selection plates suggests yeast are present, but don’t grow well on this medium (as in S288c control), then 10ul is streaked onto YPD plate as well.

YPD medium is inoculated with individual colonies or several colonies from the above plates and glycerol is added to a final concentration of 15% and the samples are stored at -80C for processing later.

Plastic tubes containing solid waste and small amounts of media are disposed of (with lids closed) in the biohazard bags for autoclaving. Contaminated media should be disposed of by adding 10% Bleach for 24 hours before flushing down the sink with plenty of water.
